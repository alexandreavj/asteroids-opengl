## how to score points?

In each round, you will have 3 lives. Each time the spaceship hits an asteroid, one life is lost.
Each time you fire and hit an asteroid, you win as much points as the size of the asteroid you have just destroyed.
Bigger asteroids may split into two smaller ones. Be careful!
